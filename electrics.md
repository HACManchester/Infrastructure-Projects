Overview
========

This is a list of the remaining work and items that may be needed


General
======

RCBOs of appropriate type and ratings are needed before we can make
the system fully safe.


List of circuits:

Grey (arts) DB2:

- 20A for metalworking
- 20A for welding
- 20A for dado rails/etc
- 20A for green room
- 20A for water heater
- 20A for classroom sockets


Brown main (DB)

- 6A for lights #1
- 6A for lights #2
- 20A for main radial 1
- 20A for main radial 2
- 20A for electronics area
- 20A for kitchen area
- 20A for kitchen water heater
- 20A for under kitchen sockets
- 20A for cnc room
[ note, there's a one breaker with two circuits ]
- entrance circuit is coupled with electronics i think




Emergency lighting
==================

This requires a full test to ensure that the lights run for the
required time and that there are sufficient lights for anyone to
make an emergency exit.

Note, the main area may require some more emergency lighting.

The landlord's supply currently runs the lighting on the outside
edge of the hackspace. We may want to leave this for the moment
as it is all permanently on.


Main lighting
=============

Power draw checks need to be made and then any further action can
be taken. It is possible some of the old flourescent tube fittings
will need to be replaced.

It has been noted fititng LED tubes and switches has significantly
reduced the electricity bill. Changing all tubes out should be considered
or replacing the tubes entirely in the areas where more light is required.


Main toilet
===========

The emergency alarm has been fitted and needs final test. It is possible
an second sounder in the main area will be added before completion.

There are 1 or 2 32W LED panels the same as the back of the stage to
be fitted to provide lighting. The LED panels have been purchased.

If extraction is required a switched/fuse will need to be fitted and
appropriate fan isolation. This should not require extra expense apart
from the purchase of a suitable extraction fan.


Water heater
============

There is a 2.5kW water heater which is intended to provide hot water
to the classroom area, the main toilet and possibly also the green
room sink.

This will need a separate supply and fused connection unit. We should
have the connection parts, but will need enough cable.

The location for this will need to be determined, but it could be put
in the area above the green room as it is close to water and electrical
feed.

Notes, do we need to put copper pipe on the in/out and earth bond this
to the main earth feed?


Class room
==========

To finalise the electrical plans for this concrete designs are needed.

Current assumptions are:

Feed the lighting from the same supply that goes to the main toilet,
via a conduit that's currently already partly through the entrance
area. The actual lighting controls and feeds will depend on what sort
of lighting to put in place.

Power sockets in the dado rails (we will need some way of keeping
the sockets in the rails due to the use of. Do we also need some
sort of hanging down sockets (we do have cable baskets still around)


Class room toilet
=================

Assuming this is just going to require some sort of light with a
pull switch to turn on. No emergency alarm is planned.



Weldy
=====

One or two 32W LED panels the same as the back of the stage.
The LED panels have been purchased, all that required is to fit them.

There are four standard 13A double sockets to be fitted. These are
already purchased and require the time to fit them.

We have 16A and 32A C-form sockets available to fit if required.

Any other power for specific welders needs to be discussed. 3 phase
can be fitted, but will require parts.


CNC
===

This requires proper lighting on our circuit and possibly more sockets.

The current landlord lighting and emergency lighting also goes through
here. This needs to be tidied up. No further items should be required
for this work.


Woody dusty
===========

Sockets to be finished in here.

Emergency cutoff system to be fitted/specified

2 more LED light tube fittings are ready to be fitted.

Note, the "far" radial goes through here, we may require this to be
moved so that the emergency cutoff can do all the sockets in there without
removing power to that side of the space.


Other items
===========

- We will probably run out of 4mm2 cable. £105 for 100M
- We may require more lighting cable. At worst £42 for 100M
- General 20mm conduit and fittings.
